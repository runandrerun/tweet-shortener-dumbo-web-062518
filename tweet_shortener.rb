# Below the .split.collect splits a STRING (tweet) into an array (separates each word into an index). Then iterate over each index (|word|). This then checks if any of the dictionary hash's keys are included. If so, the word is substituted with the value from the dictionary hash. Else, the word is printed. Then .join(" ") is called to put it back into a string using spaces in between each word.
